## Technologies Used
-React Native: Main framework for mobile app development.

-JavaScript/TypeScript: Main programming language used for the application.

-React Navigation: Manage navigation between screens.

-Axios/Fetch: Make API requests to fetch Pokémon data.

-Public PokéAPI: Source for Pokémon data.

-Additional packages and libraries as needed (e.g., styling libraries, state management such as Redux or Context API).

## Get started
1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npm expo start
   ```
In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
